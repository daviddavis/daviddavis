# Hi 👋 I'm David (he/him)!

I'm a software engineer with a lifelong ❤️ for free and open-source software (FOSS) and Linux 🐧
since installing Red Hat Linux on my computer as a teenager in the late '90s.

The main language I currently use today is Python 🐍 but I love learning new programming languages.

I use the command line 🚀 whenever I can. For my IDE, I use [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and 
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) but have recently started using [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

Check out my [📁dotfiles](https://github.com/daviddavis/dotfiles) repo
for more info about the 🛠️ tools I use and how I configure them.

When I am not coding I love to ride my 🚲, read 📚, and hang out with my 🐶🐶.
