# Hi 👋 I'm David!

I'm a software engineer with a lifelong ❤️ for free and open-source software (FOSS) and 🐧 Linux
since switching from Windows to Red Hat Linux in the late '90s.

The main language I currently use today is 🐍 Python but I love learning new programming languages.

I use the 🚀 command line whenever I can. For an IDE, I am using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and 
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) but I've recently started using [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

Check out my [📁dotfiles](https://github.com/daviddavis/dotfiles) repo
for more info about the 🛠️ tools I use and how I configure them.

When I am not coding I love to ride 🚲 bicycles, read 📚 books, and hang out with my 🐶 pups.
