# Hi 👋 I'm David!

I'm a software engineer with a lifelong passion for free open-source software (FOSS) and 🐧 Linux
since switching from Windows to Red Hat Linux in the late '90s.

The main language I currently use today is 🐍 Python but I love learning new programming languages.

I use the command line whenever I can. For an IDE, I am using vim and tmux but I've recently started
using [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

When I am not coding I love to ride 🚲 bicycles, read 📚 books, and hang out with my 🐶 pups.
