# 👋 Hi I'm David (he/him)

I'm a software engineer with a lifelong passion for free and open-source software
(FOSS) and Linux since first installing Red Hat Linux in the late '90s. The main 
language I currently use today is Python 🐍 but I love learning new programming 
languages.

I use the command line whenever I can. For my IDE, I use neovim or vim and tmux.
My other interests include ZFS, SBCs (Raspberry Pi), self-hosting, and running
LLMs to heat up my home office during the winter.

When I am not coding I love to ride my 🚲, read 📚, and hang out with my 🐶🐶.
Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/daviddavis/dotfiles) repo for more
info about the tools I use and how I configure them.
